If you are completely lost or stuck with your data wrangling or analysis there are a number of great ressources you can access. I would suggest you read these first rather than do a general google search. 

### Data Wrangling

1. Dr. Jenny Bryan's Stat 545 course is available on GitHub [http://stat545.com/topics.html](http://stat545.com/topics.html). Fantastic ressource.

2. RStudio has a number of cheat sheets if you can't quite remember the exact bit of code you need. I have these up all the time. 
    i) [Data Import](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-import-cheatsheet.pdf)
    ii) [Data Transformation](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-transformation-cheatsheet.pdf)
    iii) [RMarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)
    iiii) [ggplot2](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf)
    iiiii) Many more [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
    
### Data Analysis

1. I use the [ULCA Institute for Digital Research and Education](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/) a lot when I'm running analyses, often I need to do a non trivial analysis in a new software (I'm looking at you SAS) but don't know the code very well. This helps get oriented quickly. [Data Analysis Examples](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/dae/).

2. Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) provides a nice overview of modelling in [section 4: Model](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html).

### Stackoverflow

1. If you are really stuck, have posted your question to Slack, I can't figure it out, you read a bunch of tutorials, and still can't figure it out, it's time to turn to your friends on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stackoverflow is an online community for asking questions and getting help about code. Follow these rules:  
    i) Search to see your question has been asked
    ii) [Ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)  
    iii) Create a [reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
