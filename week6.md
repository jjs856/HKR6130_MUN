## HKR 6130 Week 6    

## Introduction

This week we you will be exploring the world of mobile apps and devices for physical activity data collection. Your task this week is to explore the Google and Apple app stores for apps that allow data physical activity data collection. If you have a personal wearable device (Fitbit, Apple Watch, Garmin, Polar, etc) you can also include that device in the review. 

Your *n of 1* study proposal is also due for week 7. I have provided a description of the proposal below.

## Objectives

1. Explore the word of mobile apps and wearable devices for physical activity data collection.  
2. Learn about data availability from these apps and collect some data.   

## Tasks

1. Conduct a review of 5-10 (minimum 5, maximum 10) apps for collecting physical activity and spatial location data in the Google Play or Apple App Store. The review should include the following:   
    i) App developer information: Who developed the app?   
    ii) Cost: How much does the app cost?   
    iii) Data availability: Can the user access their own data? In what formats?   
    iiii) Privacy policy: Does the developer sell the data to third parties?   
    iiiii) Usage: Is it feasible to use the app for your research project? What are the advantages/disadvantages?  
2. Chose 1 of the apps and collect 1 day of data using your phone. Present a brief overview of the data using R and RMarkdown.  
3. Submit your data, Rmd file, and rendered PDF document to Brightspace.  

Some suggestions for apps that you may want to include:   
    1. Apple, Samsung, or Google Health Apps already on the phone   
    2. [Moves](https://moves-app.com/)   
    3. [Itinerum](https://itinerum.ca/)   
    4. [Ethica Data](https://www.ethicadata.ca/)   

There are **many** more apps out there. Do some digging, see what you can find. 

## Template

Below is a Markdown template for your guide. Please use this so we can ensure a consistent format for all of the app reviews.

## App Review

### App Name

1. Developer information
2. Available on [Apple](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/) and [Google](https://play.google.com/store). Provide links to the app on available platforms. 
3. Cost information  

#### Data Availability

Describe the data availability. What types of data are collected? At what frequency? Daily, Minute by minute? What format does the data come in? Can I download a excel or CSV file? Do I need to connect with an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api). 

#### Privacy Policy

Does the company or app sell your data? What measures are in place to keep your data safe? What controls do you have over the data? Can you change how much data is being collected, the data sources, etc? 

#### Usage

1. Is it feasible to use the app for your research project? 
2. What are the advantages/disadvantages?
    i) Advantages?  
    ii) Disadvantages?

## *N of 1* study

### Description

The purpose of the *n of 1* study is to design a research project using yourself as the the participant. You will be required to collect data for 2 weeks. The first week, you will track your behaviour using the app of your choice but you will not change your behaviour. The second week, you will change your behaviour and track those changes using the same app. Your intervention (change in behaviour) will need to be developped based on the academic literature examine what works to change physical activity behaviour. Possible interventions may include: 

    i) Walking or cycling to work every day
    ii) Meeting a 13,000 steps / day goal
    iii) Using a standing desk

These are just suggestions. Feel free to explore the world of research in physical activity behaviour change. 

### Sections 

Your *n of 1* study proposal should be one page and include the following information. 

1. A description of previous research that supports your intervention or suggests that your intervention will increase your level of physical activity. This should include support from 5-10 academic publications. The section should be 1/2 page. 

2. Your research question and hypothesis. Describe your research question and hypothesis for the study. You should only have 1 research question and 1 hypothesis. The section should be 1 paragraph.

3. Your methods. What will your outcome (dependent) variable be for the study. How will you analyze the data? How will create figures and tables to examine whether your intervention increased your physical activity? This section should be 2 paragraphs. 

4. The app you will use to collect your data. What app will you be using? What data are available from the app? This section should be 2 paragraphs. 

### Format

The paper should be formatted using a standard academic format. I would suggest that APA and AMA are good choices. You can use MS Word or another word processor for the study proposal. You are not required to use Markdown. References should be included on a separate page.
