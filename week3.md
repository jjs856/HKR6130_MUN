## HKR 6130 Week 3  

## Introduction

This week we will focus on reading a discussing intervention design. We will focus on quasi- and natural experiments for this course. These designs are useful in the educational and built environment research context and will provide a good framework for thinking about intervention more generally. We will not focus on randomized controlled trials in this course.  

During the readings spend some energy thinking about what you would like to do for your **n of 1** study. This could be something like walking or cycling to work one week, using a standing desk, or doing some sort or challenge. The goal is to collect one week of data before and one week of data during the intervention. We will be simplifying the **n of 1** study design for the purpose of this course and only using an AB design. 

## Objectives  

1. Think about quasi- and natural experimental design.  
2. Start planning your **n of 1** study.   
3. Write a short reflection blog post.

## Reflection Questions

1. What are the key design elements for a quasi or natural experiment to make strong causal claims?  
2. Why do the key design elements improve causal claims quasi or natural experiment studies? 
4. What are differences/similarities between **n of 1** studies and quasi or natural experiment studies? 

## Tasks

1. Choose a blogging platform or website platform. I recommend using [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) or [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). 
2. Write a blog post (max 500 words) describing the main discussion points of the readings.
3. Post the link to the D2L Discussion Forum *Blog post links*.
