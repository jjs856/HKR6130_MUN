## HKR 6130 Week 1 

## Introduction

This week we will focus on reading a discussing the conceptual and general measurement issues related to physical activity and location data, what Jankowska et al., have described as "spatial engergetics". The papers are desiged to get us thinking about we mean when we say physical activity, spatial location, and how we can combine the two.

## Objectives

1. Think physical activity and spatical location measurement. 
2. Write a short reflection blog post.
