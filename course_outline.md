### Course Description
This course will introduce students to physical activity measurement using accelerometer devices including smartphones, smartwatches. I will also introduce students to measuring spatial location using Global Positioning Systems. The course will explore conceptual aspects of physical activity and spatial location measurement. Students will design, conduct, and analyse data for a small-scale intervention collecting accelerometer measured physical activity and GPS data. Students will learn programming in R and QGIS for spatial analysis methods. 

### Course Objectives
1. Demonstrate an understanding of objective physical activity and spatial location measurement  
2. Compare and contrast available technologies for physical activity measurement  
3. Basic programming in R and QGIS  
4. Design, conduct, and analyse data from a small-scale intervention using smart devices
