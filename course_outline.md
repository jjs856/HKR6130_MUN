### Course Description
This course will introduce students to physical activity measurement using accelerometer devices including smartphones, smartwatches. I will also introduce students to measuring spatial location using Global Positioning Systems. The course will explore conceptual aspects of physical activity and spatial location measurement. Students will design, conduct, and analyse data for a small-scale intervention collecting accelerometer measured physical activity and GPS data. Students will learn programming in R and QGIS for spatial analysis methods. 

### Course Objectives
1. Demonstrate an understanding of objective physical activity and spatial location measurement  
2. Compare and contrast available technologies for physical activity measurement  
3. Basic programming in R and QGIS  
4. Design, conduct, and analyse data from a small-scale intervention using smart devices  


### Academic Integrity
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the [Memorial University’s Code of Conduct](http://www.mun.ca/student/sscm/conduct/). You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities
In compliance with the Memorial University’s policy and equal access laws, it is understood that appropriate academic accommodations may be required for student with disabilities. Please see the [guide](http://www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239) for full details.

I purposefuly do not have due dates or deadlines for my courses. You will have the most success with this course if you submit the assignments the weeks they are presented in the course. There will be a steep learning curve for R. It will hurt. The faster you get over the learning curve, the easier, and more fun, your life will be in this course.  

There are no specific formatting rules or guidelines for the course related to references. Use some type of reference formatting, APA and AMA are good choices. You will be using Markdown for most of the work so formatting mostly takes care of itself.

#### App Review (15%)

1. Conduct a review of 5-10 (minimum 5, maximum 10) apps for collecting physical activity and spatial location data in the Google Play or Apple App Store. The review should include the following: 
    i) App developer information: Who developed the app? 
    ii) Cost: How much does the app cost? 
    iii) Data availability: Can the user access their own data? In what formats? 
    iiii) Privacy policy: Does the developer sell the data to third parties? 
    iiiii) Usage: Is it feasible to use the app for your research project? What are the advantages/disadvantages? 
2. Chose 1 of the apps and collect 1 day of data using your phone. Present a brief overview of the data using R and RMarkdown. 
3. Submit your data, Rmd file, and rendered PDF document to Brightspace. 

#### Study Proposal	(15%)

1. Write a 2 page study proposal for your *n of 1* study. Describe the following in detail: 
    i) The intervention you will be subjecting yourself to
    ii) The app you will be using for data collecting
    iii) Your data analysis plan
    iiii) Your contigency plan for the app bonks

#### GIS Tutorial	(10%)

1. Complete the GIS tutorial using **XYZ**.
2. Submit your data, Rmd file, and rendered PDF document to Brightspace.
