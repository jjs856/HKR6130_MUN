### Course Description
This course will introduce students to physical activity measurement using accelerometer devices including smartphones, smartwatches. I will also introduce students to measuring spatial location using Global Positioning Systems. The course will explore conceptual aspects of physical activity and spatial location measurement. Students will design, conduct, and analyse data for a small-scale intervention collecting accelerometer measured physical activity and GPS data. Students will learn programming in R and ArcGIS for spatial analysis methods. 

Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: 
•	Demonstrate an understanding of objective physical activity and spatial location measurement
•	Compare and contrast available technologies for physical activity measurement
•	Basic programming in R and QGIS
•	Design, conduct, and analyse data from a small-scale intervention using smart devices

III. Format and Procedures:
This class will feature in-class lectures and discussions, labs, self-directed data collection and analysis. 

IV. Course Text:
There is no specific text for this course. A list of readings will provided for relevant in class sessions. Resources to help with software applications will also be provided.


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
