## HKR 6130 Week 7  

## Introduction

This week you will read some book chapters and journal articles that introduce the concepts of geography, in particular Geographic Information System/Science (GIS). The overall aim is to become familiar with the basic elements of GIS, including the types of spatial objects, spatial data structures, spatial autocorrelation and several inherent problems in geography studies, and get prepared for GPS data analysis in the following two weeks.   

## Objectives  

1. Understand how geographic phenomena are represented in digital computers, especially by what types of spatial objects (i.e., point, line, and area);
2. Differentiate between vector and raster data structures;
3. Understand Tobler’s First Law of Geography;
4. Be aware of several issues in geography studies, in particular the Uncertain Geographic Context Problem which emphasizes the importance of using GPS to capture individuals’ activities.

## Readings 

*Note. Some the readings are from text book chapters and are posted in the D2L. Please check D2L for the readings without weblinks.*

## Reflection Questions

1.	What type of spatial object does GPS data belong to? And in what data structure?
2.	What are the advantages of using GPS data in representing individuals’ activities?
