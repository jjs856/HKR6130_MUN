## Prerequisites
None

##Course Description
This course will introduce students to physical activity measurement using research grade accelerometers and commercial devices including smartphones and smartwatches. We will also discuss concepts of intervention as they relate to physical education. Students will design a small scale intervention and conduct an analyse using R. Students will learn programming in R. 

## Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Demonstrate an understanding of device based physical activity 
- Compare and contrast available technologies for physical activity measurement
- Understand the basics of interventions and intervention evaluation
- Basic programming in R 
- Design, conduct, and analyse data from an intervention

## Format and Procedures
This class is online. 

## Course Text
There is no specific text for this course. A list of readings will provided for relevant in class sessions. Resources to help with software applications will also be provided.

## Methods of assessment:

1.	Weekly Assignments 			            40%
2.	Intro to R				                  15%
3.	Accelerometer Data in R		          15%
4.	Intervention Proposal			          10%
5.	Intervention Evaluation in R	      15%
6.	Intervention Evaluation	Report	    20%

### Weekly Assignments									
Each instructor will use their own format for evaluating the lab component of this course. In general, this portion of the evaluation will consist of a paper or lab write-up. Instructors will provide information about the specific content of this portion of the evaluation at the beginning of their lecture period.

### Intro to R										
Complete the Intro to R session. 

### Accelerometer Data in R

### Intervention Proposal

### Intervention Evaluation in R

### Intervention Evaluation Report

## Academic Integrity
A student is expected to adhere to principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. Please refer to the University Calendar 6.12: http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0748 Information regarding acceptable writing practices is available through the Writing Centre at http://www.mun.ca/writingcentre/
 
The School of Human Kinetics and Recreation now has a Committee for Academic Integrity. If there is an allegation of academic misconduct for evaluative instruments worth between 15-39% the course instructor is required to submit the work as submitted along with a summary of the allegation to the SHKR Committee for consideration and a decision. Any allegations of evaluative instruments worth 40% or more of the final grade or final examinations are automatically sent to the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies for consideration.

## Accommodations for students with disabilities
In compliance with the Memorial Universityâ€™s policy and equal access laws, it is understood that appropriate academic accommodations may be required for student with disabilities. Please see the guide for full details http://www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239.
