E-mail: dfuller@mun.ca
Office: PE2023

## Office Hours
Time: Fridays from 10:30-11:30am (NL time) 
Location: PE2023 or online https://whereby.com/walkabilly

## Prerequisites
None

##Course Description
This course will introduce students to physical activity measurement using research grade accelerometers and commercial devices including smartphones and smartwatches. We will also discuss concepts of intervention as they relate to physical education. Students will design a small scale intervention and conduct an analyse using R. Students will learn programming in R. 

## Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Demonstrate an understanding of device based physical activity 
- Compare and contrast available technologies for physical activity measurement
- Understand the basics of interventions and intervention evaluation
- Basic programming in R 
- Design, conduct, and analyse data from an intervention

## Format and Procedures
This class is online. 

## Course Text
There is no specific text for this course. A list of readings will provided for relevant in class sessions. Resources to help with software applications will also be provided.

## Methods of assessment:

 Assignment | Percent
 ------------------------------------ | ---- 
 Regular Assignments | 40% 
 Intro to R | 15% 
 Accelerometer Data in R | 15% 
 Intervention Proposal | 10% 
 Intervention Evaluation in R | 15% 
 Intervention Evaluation	Report | 20% 

__Note 1.__ I purposefuly do not have penalties for late assignments in my courses. You will have the most success with this course if you submit the assignments the weeks suggested. There will be a steep learning curve for R. It will hurt. The faster you get over the learning curve, the easier, and more fun, your life will be in this course.  

__Note 2.__ There are no specific formatting rules or guidelines for the course related to references. Use some type of reference formatting, APA and AMA are good choices. You will be using Markdown for most of the work so formatting mostly takes care of itself. 

### Regular Assignments									
Regular assignments will be outlined in the Weekly Outline table. 

### Intro to R										
1. Complete the R and RMarkdown tutorial.
2. Submit your RMarkdown file and rendered PDF document to Brightspace. 

### Accelerometer Data in R
1. Complete the Accelerometer data analysis lab using R and RMarkdown.
2. Submit your data, Rmd file, and rendered PDF document to Brightspace. 

### Intervention Proposal
1. Write a 4 page study proposal for your proposed intervention study. Describe the following in detail:   
    i) The intervention you would like to evaluate
    ii) The type of outcome data you will use (e.g., step count, moderate-vigorous physical activity)
    iii) The sample population and how you will recruit students
    iiii) A hypothesis about the intervention effect 
2. This project will be completed in groups of 2. I will assign the groups. 
3. Once you submit your intervention proposal. I will generate a dataset based on your proprosal. The intervention evaluation report will require you to analyze the dataset to determine if your hypothesis is correct. 

### Intervention Evaluation in R

### Intervention Evaluation Report
1. In the same groups as the Intervention Proposal Assignment write a 3000 word report detailing intervention evaluation.
2. You can include the information from your Intervention Proposal in the report. 

## Academic Integrity
A student is expected to adhere to principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. Please refer to the University Calendar 6.12: http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0748 Information regarding acceptable writing practices is available through the Writing Centre at http://www.mun.ca/writingcentre/
 
The School of Human Kinetics and Recreation now has a Committee for Academic Integrity. If there is an allegation of academic misconduct for evaluative instruments worth between 15-39% the course instructor is required to submit the work as submitted along with a summary of the allegation to the SHKR Committee for consideration and a decision. Any allegations of evaluative instruments worth 40% or more of the final grade or final examinations are automatically sent to the Senate Committee on Undergraduate Studies for consideration.

## Accommodations for students with disabilities
In compliance with the Memorial University’s policy and equal access laws, it is understood that appropriate academic accommodations may be required for student with disabilities. Please see the guide for full details http://www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239.
